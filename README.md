## Toy-Tools ##

It's a repository for tools which are used by myself in work. 

The functions of each file are listed below.

1. auth_tsinghua.py

   A tool to connect to tsinghua university internet automatically.

   It does not work well for some unknown problem in selenium.

2. auto_internet.py

   Because of the bug in auth_tsinghua, auto_internet can maintain your connection to internet. If you do not want to lose your internet, it may work well.

3. github_accelerator.py

   A tool to show you the DNSs of some github servers, and guide you to change your hosts file.

   It works sometimes for not all failed connections to github come from DNS cache pollution.
